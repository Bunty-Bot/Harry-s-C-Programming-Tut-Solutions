# Harry-s-C-Programming-Tut-Solutions

In this repository I will be uploading the code which was given in 'CODE WITH HARRY' C-Programming tutorial.
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9aiXlHcLx-mDH1Qul38wD3aR This is the link of that tutorial.
This is a very good tutorial and it helped me a lot to learn and understand C-Programming.
In this repository I will upload the code of every single lecture. This repository also contains
the solution of the exersizes which are there in the tutorial. I suggest you please don't copy the 
exersize code but just use it for refference as it will help you a lot in future.
Thank you for Reading this file!!!
